# backend/integrations/github_models.py
#
# Pydantic models that represent GitHub REST API requests and responses.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE FILE FROM github_client.py?
#
# WIKI: Clean Architecture / Single-Responsibility-Principle
#   Each module should have one reason to change.
#   - This file changes when the GitHub API shape changes (new fields, deprecations).
#   - github_client.py changes when retry logic, timeouts, or HTTP details change.
#   - They change for different reasons -> they belong in different files.
#
# WIKI: Clean Architecture / Boundary-Lines.md
#   "Data that crosses an architectural boundary should be plain data structures."
#   -> These models are the data that crosses the boundary between the GitHub
#      API (external world) and the orchestrator (our domain).
#   -> They are Pydantic models (validated, typed) — not dicts.
#   -> This is the anti-corruption layer: we control what fields we care about,
#      and we give them names that make sense in OUR domain, not GitHub's.
#
# REUSE NOTE:
#   Phase 7  uses: PRMetadata, PRFile
#   Phase 8  uses: PRMetadata, PRFile, PostReviewPayload, PostReviewResponse
#   Phase 10 uses: PostReviewResponse (for audit logging review IDs)
#
# All models in this file are deliberately forward-complete (Phase 8 models
# are defined now even though they are not wired in yet). This is because
# adding a model later would require touching this file AND github_client.py
# at the same time — two reasons to change on the same ticket.
# Better to define the shape now when the design is fresh.
