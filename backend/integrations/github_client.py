# backend/integrations/github_client.py
#
# Async GitHub REST API client.
#
# THE ONLY PLACE IN THE CODEBASE THAT TALKS TO GITHUB.
#
# Public API (what the orchestrator uses):
#   client = GitHubClient(settings)
#   metadata = await client.get_pr_metadata(repo, pr_number)
#   diff     = await client.get_pr_diff(repo, pr_number)
#   files    = await client.get_pr_files(repo, pr_number)
#   response = await client.post_pr_review(repo, pr_number, payload)  # Phase 8
#
# STABILITY PRINCIPLES (from release-it wiki):
#
# 1. TIMEOUTS on every call (Timeouts.md)
#    "Well-placed timeouts provide fault isolation; a problem in some other
#     system does not have to become your problem."
#    -> _TIMEOUT is an httpx.Timeout with separate connect/read/write values.
#    -> No call can block forever. Thread exhaustion is prevented.
#
# 2. RETRY with exponential backoff — 5xx only (Stability-Patterns.md)
#    "Immediate retries are liable to hit the same problem and result in
#     another timeout. That just makes the user wait even longer."
#    -> We retry 5xx responses and network errors: wait 1s, 2s, 4s.
#    -> We do NOT retry 4xx (deterministic failures — retrying is pointless).
#    -> We do NOT retry 429 blindly. We raise GitHubRateLimitError immediately
#       so the caller can decide (back off, queue, alert).
#
# 3. RATE LIMIT awareness (Stability-Antipatterns.md)
#    "Stability antipatterns transform transient events into catastrophic outages."
#    -> We check X-RateLimit-Remaining after every response.
#    -> If remaining < 100: log WARNING (operator can react before we hit 0).
#    -> If 429: raise GitHubRateLimitError (carries Retry-After seconds).
#
# 4. EXPLICIT ERROR HIERARCHY
#    3 exception types so callers can catch at the right level:
#    - GitHubAPIError (base, all GitHub errors)
#    - GitHubNotFoundError (404: PR or repo doesn't exist)
#    - GitHubRateLimitError (429: we're being throttled)
#    This replaces catching bare httpx.HTTPStatusError everywhere.
#
# 5. CONFIGURABLE BASE URL (Operations-Patterns.md)
#    "Don't accept connections until start-up is complete."
#    "Trust, but verify."
#    -> base_url comes from settings.github_api_base_url (default: api.github.com)
#    -> Enables GitHub Enterprise support.
#    -> Enables smoke tests to use an httpx MockTransport (no live network).
#
# 6. NO GLOBAL STATE (Stability-Antipatterns.md)
#    "Hiding sockets in vendor libraries: client libraries that wrap socket
#     connections make it hard to set timeouts."
#    -> GitHubClient is instantiated explicitly (passed to nodes via DI).
#    -> No module-level singleton. No shared mutable state between requests.
#    -> The httpx.AsyncClient is created once per GitHubClient instance
#       and closed in close().

# Usage pattern:

#   except GitHubRateLimitError as e:

#   except GitHubAPIError:

# TIMEOUT CONFIGURATION
#
# WIKI: release-it / Timeouts.md
#   "It is essential that any resource pool that blocks threads must have a
#    timeout to ensure threads are eventually unblocked."
#   "Infinite Wait on Network Calls: Code blocks indefinitely waiting for a
#    response from a remote system that may never reply."
#
# We set FOUR separate timeouts (httpx supports all four independently):
#   connect  — how long to wait for the TCP connection to be established
#   read     — how long to wait for the server to start sending response bytes
#              (this is where a hung server will stall us — set it generously
#               but not infinite: GitHub diffs can be large)
#   write    — how long to wait to send our request body (POST review payload)
#   pool     — how long to wait for an available connection from the pool
#
# These values are conservative defaults. They can be tuned in production
# via environment variables when we add observability (Phase 10).
# =============================================================================

_TIMEOUT = httpx.Timeout(
    connect=5.0,   # TCP handshake: 5s is generous for api.github.com

    write=10.0,    # Posting review payloads (inline comments)
    pool=5.0,      # Waiting for a connection from the pool
)

# =============================================================================
# RETRY CONFIGURATION
#
# WIKI: release-it / Stability-Patterns.md
#   "Immediate retries are liable to hit the same problem."
#   -> We use exponential backoff: _BACKOFF_SECONDS[attempt] seconds before retry.
#      attempt=0: wait 1s, attempt=1: wait 2s, attempt=2: wait 4s.
#
# WHY 3 RETRIES AND NOT MORE?
# 3 retries = worst case 1+2+4 = 7 seconds of extra wait on top of timeouts.
# More retries would delay the PR author too long (they are waiting for feedback).
# 3 is the "magic number" from release-it: enough to handle transient 502s,
# not so many that we amplify a real outage into a long-running hang.

_MAX_RETRIES = 3
_BACKOFF_SECONDS = [1.0, 2.0, 4.0]  # exponential backoff delays per attempt

# =============================================================================
# DIFF SIZE GUARD
#
# GitHub returns a raw unified diff via the Accept: application/vnd.github.diff header.
# For very large PRs (thousands of files, generated code, lock files),
# this diff can be multiple megabytes.
#
# WIKI: LLMOps-Essentials.md
#   "More context is not always better — irrelevant context dilutes the signal."
#   "What is not in the context does not exist for the agent."
# -> We hard-cap the diff at MAX_DIFF_BYTES. If the diff is larger:
#    1. We truncate it and log a WARNING with the original size.
#    2. The agents see the truncated diff (still valuable — usually the
#       important changes are in the first N files).
#    3. The quality_agent should flag "diff too large" as a finding.
#
# 500KB is generous but bounded. Most PRs are well under 50KB.
# Adjust MAX_DIFF_BYTES in settings (Phase 18) when we add diff filtering
# (strip lockfiles, generated files, etc.)
