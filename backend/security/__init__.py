Phase 11: Security Architecture
================================
Public API surface for the security module. Everything the rest of the
application needs lives here — importers should never reach into sub-modules.

Exports are grouped by concern:

  Masking         — PII / secret redaction before LLM calls
  Injection Guard — Prompt injection detection and sanitisation
  RBAC            — Role-based access control for API operators
  Threat Model    — Unified threat assessment entry-point

Wiki ref: Production-Hardening "Guards on the input side. Guards on the
output side. Guards around tool calls. Each guardrail is independent. Each
can block." (llmops-ai-agents/concepts/Production-Hardening.md)
