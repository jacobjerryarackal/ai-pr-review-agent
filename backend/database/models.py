# backend/database/models.py
#
# SQLAlchemy ORM table definitions for the structured persistence layer.
#
# TABLES:
#   PRReviewRecord   — one row per PR review run
#   FindingRecord    — one row per finding within a review
#
# DESIGN DECISIONS:
#
# 1. UUID PRIMARY KEYS (from Storage-Engines.md wiki):
#    "Use UUIDs for distributed-safe primary keys."
#    Integer auto-increment IDs create a bottleneck: every insert must hit the
#    sequence. UUIDs are generated client-side (no DB round-trip) and work
#    safely across multiple application instances. We generate them in Python
#    (uuid.uuid4()) not in the DB, so the app controls the ID before insert.
#
# 2. COMPOSITE INDEX ON (repo_full_name, severity):
#    (From Storage-Engines.md wiki, "Index Design"):
#    "Index the columns you filter on, in the order you filter them."
#    The most common query is: "all HIGH+ findings for repo X in last 30 days"
#    That's WHERE repo_full_name = ? AND severity IN (?, ?).
#    A composite index on (repo_full_name, severity) serves this query in O(log n)
#    instead of a full table scan.
#    ORDER: repo_full_name first (higher cardinality prefix = better selectivity).
#
# 3. ENUM AS VARCHAR:
#    (From Production-Hardening.md wiki, "Operational Flexibility"):
#    Storing enum values as VARCHAR rather than native DB ENUM types means
#    we can add new enum values without a DB migration.
#    Native ENUM requires ALTER TYPE in Postgres — a DDL operation that takes
#    an exclusive lock. VARCHAR avoids that operational risk.
#    Trade-off: no DB-level enum validation. We enforce that in the Python layer
#    (ReviewStatus, FindingSeverity etc. are validated before insert).
#
# 4. RELATIONSHIP LOADING:
#    FindingRecord has a FK to PRReviewRecord.
#    We use lazy="selectin" so that when we load a PRReviewRecord, SQLAlchemy
#    automatically loads its findings in a second SELECT (not N+1 queries).
#    "selectin" is the async-safe loading strategy — "lazy" loading (the default)
#    does not work with async sessions.
#    (Storage-Engines.md: "N+1 queries are the #1 async ORM footgun.")
