#
# Async SQLAlchemy engine, session factory, and dependency injection.
#
# WHY ASYNC SQLALCHEMY?
# (From Storage-Engines.md wiki, "Async Database Patterns"):
#   "Synchronous sessions block the event loop — every DB query pauses ALL
#    incoming requests until it completes. In an async framework like FastAPI,
#    this means one slow query can stall the entire server."
#   Solution: create_async_engine() + AsyncSession. Every DB call becomes a
#   coroutine that yields control while waiting for I/O.
#
# CONNECTION POOL DESIGN:
# (From Storage-Engines.md wiki, "Connection Pooling"):
#   "Pool exhaustion under load is a common failure mode. Size the pool to
#    match your expected concurrency, then add max_overflow as a safety valve."
#   pool_size=5:      5 persistent connections always open, ready to serve
#   max_overflow=10:  up to 10 extra connections allowed under burst load
#   pool_timeout=30:  wait up to 30s for a connection before raising an error
#   pool_recycle=1800: recycle connections every 30 min (avoids stale TCP issue
#                      where DB has closed a connection the pool thinks is alive)
#
# SESSION FACTORY PATTERN:
# (From Orthogonality.md, Pragmatic Programmer wiki):
#   "Eliminate the effects between unrelated things."
#   Each request gets its own session. Sessions do not cross request boundaries.
#   expire_on_commit=False: prevents SQLAlchemy from invalidating ORM objects
#   after commit. Without this, accessing obj.field after commit raises
#   MissingGreenlet because SQLAlchemy tries to lazy-load in an async context.
#
# get_db() DEPENDENCY:
# (From Design-by-Contract.md wiki):
#   "The session is opened before yield, closed after — guaranteed."
#   FastAPI's dependency injection calls get_db() as an async generator.
#   yield gives the session to the route handler.
#   The finally block ensures the session is always closed, even on exception.
#   This is the contract: every caller gets a clean session, and it is always
#   returned to the pool when done.

# ORM Base class
#
# All ORM models in database/models.py inherit from this Base.
# SQLAlchemy uses it to track the metadata (table names, columns, indexes)
# needed for create_all() / migrate operations.
#
# WHY MODULE-LEVEL BASE AND NOT IN models.py?
# postgres.py is the "engine room". models.py is the "schema room".
# If Base lived in models.py, postgres.py would import from models.py,
# creating a circular dependency: postgres.py <- models.py <- postgres.py.
# By defining Base here and having models.py import it from postgres.py,
# the dependency flows in one direction only.
# (Orthogonality principle: no circular imports.)

# Engine and session factory (module-level, created once)
#
# WHY MODULE-LEVEL?
# The engine is expensive to create (sets up connection pool, reads settings).
# We create it once when this module is first imported and reuse it for the
# lifetime of the process. This is safe because SQLAlchemy engines are
# thread-safe and coroutine-safe.
#
# LAZY INITIALIZATION:
# We call get_settings() here at module load time. This is acceptable because
# postgres.py is only imported by main.py (lifespan) and repository.py —
# never imported speculatively at startup before settings are configured.
