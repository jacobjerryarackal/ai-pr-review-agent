# backend/data/freshness.py
#
# Embedding freshness tracker.
#
# ROLE IN THE SYSTEM:
#   Qdrant is a DERIVED DATA STORE — it can be rebuilt from the primary source
#   (GitHub file content) at any time. But rebuilding everything on every
#   ingestion run is wasteful. This module tracks WHAT has already been
#   embedded so we only re-embed files that changed.
#
# DERIVED DATA PATTERN (Derived-Data-Systems.md wiki):
#   "Secondary indexes can be rebuilt from the primary source at any time.
#    The source of truth is always the primary store."
#
#   PRIMARY: GitHub file content (identified by blob SHA)
#   DERIVED:  Qdrant vector embeddings
#   TRACKER:  repo_file_index table in Postgres (what SHA we last embedded)
#
#   The blob SHA is GitHub's content-addressable identifier for a file blob.
#   If the file content changes, GitHub assigns a new SHA. If SHA matches what
#   we have in repo_file_index, the file is FRESH. If not (new file, or content
#   changed), the file is STALE and must be re-embedded.
#
# SESSION PATTERN (demo-day-readiness skill, Bug #2):
#   get_db() is defined as `async def ... yield` — an async GENERATOR.
#   You cannot use `async with get_db()` — it raises AttributeError: __aenter__.
#   CORRECT pattern: use async_sessionmaker directly (get_session_factory()).
#   This module receives AsyncSession objects from the caller — the caller
#   is responsible for session lifecycle. This keeps freshness.py testable
#   (tests can pass a SQLite in-memory session directly).
#
# SCHEMA NOTE (Encoding-and-Schema-Evolution.md wiki):
#   "Adding a new table is always safe — additive schema changes require no
#    migration and cannot break existing code that doesn't reference the table."
#   RepoFileIndexRecord is a NEW table — no existing code is affected.

# get_stale_files
#
# Given a repo and a {file_path: blob_sha} map of the repo's CURRENT state,
# returns a {file_path: blob_sha} map of files that need re-embedding.
#
# A file is STALE if:
#   a. It has never been embedded (no row in repo_file_index), OR
#   b. Its current SHA differs from the SHA we last embedded.
#
# A file is FRESH if its current SHA exactly matches what's in repo_file_index.
#
# BATCH QUERY: We load all existing rows for this repo in ONE query, then
# do an in-Python comparison. This avoids N+1 queries (one query per file).
# (Storage-Engines.md wiki: "Index the columns you filter on." We filter on
#  repo_full_name — it has an index in the ORM definition.)

# mark_files_embedded
#
# Upserts a row into repo_file_index to record that a file has been embedded.
# Called AFTER successful embedding and Qdrant upsert.
#
# UPSERT LOGIC:
#   If the file has never been embedded: INSERT a new row.
#   If it was previously embedded (SHA changed, re-embedded): UPDATE the row.
#
# WHY UPSERT AFTER (not before) embedding:
#   If embedding fails mid-way, we don't record it as done.
#   Next ingestion run will correctly identify it as stale and retry.
#   (demo-day-readiness Bug #4: idempotency keys set before work = false
#    "already done" on retry. Same anti-pattern — avoid it here.)
#
# MERGE STRATEGY:
#   We use SQLAlchemy's merge() which does a SELECT first, then INSERT or
#   UPDATE. This is correct for a low-volume operation (one row per file
#   per ingestion run). For bulk ingestion of thousands of files, a
#   PostgreSQL INSERT ... ON CONFLICT would be more efficient — that's a
#   future optimisation if needed (Phase 20 continuous learning may add it).
