# backend/tools/model_router.py
#
# Model router — maps each AgentType to the right model + provider.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (instead of hardcoding in each agent):
# If we hardcoded model names inside SecurityAgent, QualityAgent, etc.:
#   - Switching from gpt-4o-mini to gpt-4-turbo means editing 3 agent files
#   - Testing with a cheaper model means editing each agent individually
#   - A/B testing two models for security analysis is impossible without branching
#
# With this router:
#   - Model decisions live in ONE place — this file
#   - Changing the model for all non-critical agents = 1 line change
#   - Override via environment variable: SECURITY_MODEL=gpt-4o (for testing)
#   - Phase 9 (Evaluation) can swap models per-agent without touching agent code
#
# THE ROUTING LOGIC (Phase 5 decision):
#
#   SECURITY agent -> claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 (Anthropic)
#     WHY: Security analysis requires deep reasoning about subtle vulnerability patterns.
#          Claude Sonnet 3.5 has stronger long-context reasoning than gpt-4o-mini.
#          Cost: ~$0.003/1k input tokens. Worth it — a missed SQL injection is expensive.
#
#   QUALITY agent -> gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI)
#     WHY: Code quality checks (naming, complexity, SOLID violations) are pattern-matching.
#          gpt-4o-mini is fast and cheap: $0.00015/1k input tokens. ~20x cheaper than Sonnet.
#          Acceptable quality loss at 10x lower cost for non-security findings.
#
#   TEST agent -> gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI)
#     WHY: Same reasoning as QUALITY — "does this diff have test coverage?" is structured.
#          No deep reasoning needed. gpt-4o-mini is sufficient.
#
#   DOCS agent -> gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI)
#     WHY: Documentation gap detection is syntactic — did you add a public function
#          without a docstring? Cheapest task of all four agents.
#
# CONTEXT BUDGET DECISIONS:
#   Why a context budget? LLMs charge by token. A large PR diff can be 50k+ tokens.
#   We truncate the diff to a per-agent budget BEFORE sending it.
#   The budget is chosen per agent based on what they actually need to read:
#     - Security: needs full changed lines (malicious code is subtle) -> 8000 tokens
#     - Quality:  needs function-level context -> 6000 tokens
#     - Test:     needs to see what was added, not necessarily full context -> 5000 tokens
#     - Docs:     just needs function signatures -> 4000 tokens
#
# ENV OVERRIDES:
#   Every model name can be overridden at runtime via environment variable.
#   This lets you:
#     - Test with a local model: SECURITY_MODEL=ollama/codellama
#     - Use cheaper models in CI: QUALITY_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
#     - A/B test models in production (Phase 9)
#   The env var takes precedence over the hardcoded default.
