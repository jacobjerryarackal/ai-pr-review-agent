#
# Sandbox — deterministic, resource-bounded code execution for syntax checking.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (wiki: Autonomous-Action-Agents):
#   "Don't try to prove code is correct (intractable), just block known-bad patterns."
#   "Relying on LLM for safety correctness is an anti-pattern."
#   The sandbox is the deterministic safety gate that sits BETWEEN the agent's
#   LLM reasoning and any real code execution. No code runs outside this sandbox.
#
# WHAT "SANDBOX" MEANS IN PHASE 7 vs. PHASE 13:
#   Phase 7 (NOW): subprocess with timeout + output cap + allowlist of commands.
#       No Docker. No network isolation. This is sufficient for SYNTAX CHECKING
#       because `python3 -c "compile(...)"` and `node --check` are:
#           - Read-only (no file writes)
#           - No network (no imports that call home)
#           - CPU-bounded (syntax check is O(n) in source length)
#
#   Phase 13 (LATER): Docker container with seccomp, no-network flag, read-only
#       filesystem. Needed for ARBITRARY code execution (e.g., running user tests).
#       Not needed here — don't over-engineer.
#
# THREAT MODEL (what this sandbox prevents):
#   - Shell injection via code argument:
#       e.g., code = '"; rm -rf /'  — blocked by NEVER using shell=True
#   - Timeout exhaustion: `while True: pass` — blocked by timeout_seconds
#   - Output flooding: `print("A" * 10_000_000)` — blocked by max_output_bytes
#   - Unsupported language smuggling: `language = "bash"` — blocked by allowlist
#
# DEPENDENCY: stdlib only (subprocess, dataclasses, time) — no extra packages.

        Heuristic guard against shell injection in the code string itself.

        IMPORTANT: this is a defense-in-depth check, not the primary defense.
        The primary defense is NEVER using shell=True in subprocess.run().
        When shell=False, the OS does not interpret metacharacters — the code
        string is passed as a raw argument, not interpolated into a shell command.

        However, for Python syntax check we do pass code as a string argument
        to `python3 -c`. Without shell=True, the shell cannot inject, but
        a crafted code string could still call os.system() etc. Since we only
        want syntax checking (not execution), we add this guard as a second layer.

        We do NOT block all shell metacharacters — valid Python code can contain
        backticks, semicolons, pipes, etc. We only block the specific patterns
        that would indicate someone is trying to escape the compile() wrapper.

            ast.parse() gives cleaner error messages with line numbers.
            compile() also works but the error messages are harder to parse.

        WHY -c with the import on the same line (not a temp file):
            A temp file write would require file system permissions and cleanup.
            For Python syntax checking, -c is simpler and equally safe.
