#
# Capability Scope — per-agent tool allowlists, enforced at call time.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (wiki: Client-Isolation-Layer):
#   "Security boundaries are hard to retrofit: Design them in from the beginning."
#   "Cross-domain tool access is dangerous: Forbid by default. Explicit allowlisting only."
#   "Monolithic agent with 100+ tools causes wild hallucination and intent confusion."
#
#   Each specialist agent has a MINIMUM set of tools it needs. SecurityAgent
#   needs secret scanning; DocsAgent does not. Giving every agent every tool:
#     1. Increases hallucination risk (LLM picks wrong tool from a huge list)
#     2. Violates least-privilege (DocsAgent calling dependency advisories is wrong)
#     3. Makes audit trails noisy (hard to tell intentional from accidental tool calls)
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#   - CAPABILITY_MAP maps AgentType -> CapabilityScope (frozenset of allowed tool names)
#   - check_capability(agent_type, tool_name) is called by BaseAgent.call_tool()
#     BEFORE the registry is consulted
#   - If the agent doesn't have the capability, CapabilityViolationError is raised
#     (not silently ignored — a policy violation is a deployment bug)
#
# WHERE CAPABILITY IS CHECKED:
#   BaseAgent.call_tool() calls check_capability() before dispatching to tool_registry.
#   The order is:
#     1. check_capability()    <- scope gate (this file)
#     2. tool_registry.call()  <- execution gate (tool_registry.py)
#     3. sandbox.run_*()       <- resource gate (sandbox.py) if applicable
#   Three independent gates, each with a different concern.
#
# DEPENDENCY: models/enums (AgentType) — no upward deps
