# backend/models/enums.py
#
# All shared enums for the PR Review Agent.
#
# WHY ENUMS?
# Without enums, different modules write status values as raw strings:
#   module A writes:  "in_progress"
#   module B checks:  "IN_PROGRESS"
#   module C checks:  "inprogress"
# All three mean the same thing but none of them match. Silent bugs.
#
# With enums, every module imports ReviewStatus and uses ReviewStatus.IN_PROGRESS.
# The value is defined exactly once. Typos become ImportErrors, not silent bugs.
#
# RULE: If a field can only take a fixed set of values, it is an enum.
#       No raw strings for status, severity, category, or role.
