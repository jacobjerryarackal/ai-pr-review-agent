# backend/core/workflow_engine.py
#
# Abstract interface for the workflow orchestration engine.
#
# WHY AN INTERFACE?
# ADR-001 says we use LangGraph now but want to be able to swap to Temporal later.
# If every module imports directly from langgraph, swapping engines means
# touching every module. That is expensive and risky.
#
# Instead: every module imports WorkflowEngine from here.
# The LangGraph implementation lives in backend/orchestrator/langgraph_engine.py
# It implements this interface.
# If we swap to Temporal: write a new class that implements WorkflowEngine.
# Nothing else in the codebase changes.
#
# This is the Dependency Inversion Principle:
#   High-level modules (orchestrator, webhook_receiver) depend on this abstraction.
#   Low-level modules (langgraph_engine) implement this abstraction.
#   Neither depends on each other directly.
#
# DESIGN BY CONTRACT (from pragmatic-programmer wiki):
#   The old return type was dict[str, Any] — that is not a contract, it is
#   "returns anything". A caller had no idea what keys exist in the dict.
#   WorkflowResult below is the real contract:
#     Postcondition: "I promise to return an object with EXACTLY these fields."
#   Callers get type safety. Mypy can verify it. Tests can assert on real fields.
