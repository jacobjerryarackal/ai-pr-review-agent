# backend/orchestrator/state.py
#
# The LangGraph workflow state — the shared data structure that travels
# through every node in the graph.
#
# MENTAL MODEL:
# Think of the state like a whiteboard in a review meeting room.
# Every participant (node) can read from the whiteboard and write to it.
# The orchestrator sets up the whiteboard at the start.
# Each specialist agent reads what they need, writes their findings.
# The aggregator reads all findings and writes the final verdict.
# The poster reads the verdict and findings to format GitHub comments.
#
# WHY TypedDict AND NOT A PYDANTIC MODEL?
# LangGraph requires TypedDict for state — it's the framework's contract.
# LangGraph reads field annotations to know what to merge when nodes return
# partial updates. With Pydantic, it cannot do that merge automatically.
# We use Pydantic for data that leaves the system (API responses, DB records).
# We use TypedDict for data that stays inside the graph.
#
# HOW STATE UPDATES WORK IN LANGGRAPH:
# Each node returns a dict with ONLY the fields it changed.
# LangGraph merges that partial dict into the full state.
# Example: fan_out_agents node only returns {"agent_results": [...]}
# LangGraph keeps all other fields unchanged.
# You never need to copy the entire state forward — just return what changed.
#
# WIKI PRINCIPLE (Orchestrator-Worker-Architecture.md):
# "Each worker needs enough context to solve its problem, but not so much
# that you blow token budgets."
# -> State is the full picture. Each node receives the full state but
#    is responsible for only reading the fields it needs.
# -> We document per field: which nodes READ it, which nodes WRITE it.

class AgentResultState(TypedDict):

    The result from one specialist agent after it finishes running.

    This lives inside PRReviewState.agent_results — one entry per agent.

    WHY A SEPARATE TYPED DICT AND NOT JUST AgentFindingSummary?
    AgentFindingSummary is a Pydantic model for data leaving the system.
    AgentResultState is the in-graph representation. It carries extra fields
    the graph needs (like whether the agent succeeded or timed out) that
    don't need to be in the external API response.
