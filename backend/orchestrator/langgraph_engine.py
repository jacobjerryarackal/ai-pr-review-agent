# backend/orchestrator/langgraph_engine.py
#
# Concrete implementation of the WorkflowEngine interface using LangGraph.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS:
# In backend/core/workflow_engine.py we defined the abstract WorkflowEngine.
# That interface says "here is what a workflow engine must be able to do."
# This file is the answer: "here is HOW LangGraph does it."
#
# THE DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE IN ACTION:
# The job queue (Phase 4), webhook router (Phase 3), and HITL system (Phase 19)
# all import WorkflowEngine from backend.core — the abstract interface.
# They do NOT import LangGraphEngine directly.
# This file is only referenced in one place: backend/main.py at startup,
# where we wire the concrete engine into the app.
# If we ever swap to Temporal: write TemporalEngine, change one line in main.py.
# Nothing else changes.
#
# RELATIONSHIP TO graph.py:
# graph.py assembles the nodes into a StateGraph and compiles it.
# This file uses that compiled graph to run reviews.
# graph.py knows about nodes. This file knows about WorkflowEngine contracts.
# They are separate because: graph structure changes (Phase 4-8) vs
# engine interface (stable from Phase 3 onwards).

    WorkflowEngine implementation backed by LangGraph.

    Implements: run(), resume(), get_state()
    All three are defined on the abstract WorkflowEngine base class.
    Python's ABC mechanism guarantees all three are implemented here —
    if any were missing, instantiating this class would raise TypeError.

    THREAD SAFETY:
    This class holds no per-review state. The compiled graph (review_graph)
    is module-level and stateless. Per-review state lives in LangGraph's
    checkpointer (keyed by workflow_id / thread_id).
    Safe to instantiate once and share across concurrent reviews.

        WHEN THIS IS CALLED:
        1. Server restarts while a review is IN_PROGRESS

        HOW LANGGRAPH CHECKPOINTING WORKS:
        After each node completes, LangGraph saves the current state to the

        same thread_id (=workflow_id), LangGraph detects the existing checkpoint,
        loads the last saved state, and resumes from the next node.
        Nodes that already completed are NOT re-run.

        STUB NOTE:
        Full checkpoint resumption requires the Redis checkpointer to be
        connected (Phase 4 gate task). Currently: without a checkpointer,
        the graph has no checkpoint to resume from — so we re-run from start.
        This will be fixed when we wire in RedisSaver.
