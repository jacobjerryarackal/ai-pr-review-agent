#
# LangGraph node functions — the actual work units in the review workflow.
#
# WHAT IS A NODE?
# In LangGraph, a node is an async function with this signature:
#   async def node_name(state: PRReviewState) -> dict
# It receives the current state, does its job, and returns a dict containing
# ONLY the fields it changed. LangGraph merges those changes into the state.
#
# NODES IN ORDER:
#   1. build_context   -> fetch PR diff from GitHub, populate context fields
#   2. fan_out_agents  -> run 4 specialist agents in PARALLEL, collect results
#   3. aggregate_results -> merge findings, decide verdict, flag HITL if needed
#   4. post_review     -> post the review to GitHub (or enqueue for HITL)
#
# WIKI PRINCIPLES APPLIED HERE:
#
# From Parallel-and-Fan-Out-Agents.md:
#   "Per-agent timeouts, not global timeout."
#   -> asyncio.wait_for() wraps each agent individually in fan_out_agents.
#   -> One slow agent cannot block results from the other three.
#
#   "The merge strategy is where correctness lives."
#   -> aggregate_results is the most logic-dense node.
#   -> Confidence-weighted voting, HITL escalation rules, conflict logging.
#
# From Orchestrator-Worker-Architecture.md:
#   "Agents are decoupled: don't know about each other."
#   -> Each agent receives only a Context slice, not the full state.
#   -> Agents never import from each other.
#
# From Stability Patterns (release-it):
#   "Every external call is a potential stab-in-the-back."
#   -> GitHub API calls in build_context and post_review are wrapped in try/except.
#   -> Timeouts are explicit on every external call.
#
# NOTE ON STUBS:
# Agents (Phase 8) and GitHub API client (Phase 7) don't exist yet.
# Each agent call here is a stub that returns placeholder findings.
# The graph structure, state flow, and merge logic are REAL.
# When Phase 7 and Phase 8 are done, we replace the stubs — no graph changes.

async def build_context(state: PRReviewState) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Fetches the PR diff, file list, and metadata from GitHub.

    This is the first node in the graph. It replaces the stub diff with
    real data from the GitHub REST API.

    WHAT IT DOES (Phase 7):
      1. Call GitHub GET /pulls/{pr_number}           -> PRMetadata
      2. Call GitHub GET /pulls/{pr_number}?Accept:diff -> raw diff string
      3. Call GitHub GET /pulls/{pr_number}/files     -> list[PRFile]
      4. Call retrieve_context_for_diff()             -> RAG context (may be "")
      5. Return all context fields in one state update dict

    FAILURE HANDLING:
      Without the diff, no agent can run. This is a HARD failure.
      GitHubNotFoundError / GitHubRateLimitError / GitHubAPIError propagate up.
      LangGraph catches the exception and WorkflowEngine returns FAILED.

      WIKI: Production-Hardening.md
        "Hard deps crash startup / optional deps warn only."
        -> GitHub API is a hard dep for build_context.
        -> RAG (Qdrant) is optional — retrieve_context_for_diff() never raises.

    WIKI: Stability-Patterns.md
      "View other enterprise systems with suspicion and distrust."
      -> GitHubClient wraps every call in timeout + retry + error classification.
      -> We do NOT write bare httpx calls here. All GitHub knowledge lives
         in GitHubClient. This node only calls the clean public API.

    #   transient events into catastrophic outages."
    # -> Sequential is safer here. If call 1 fails (404 / 429), we raise
    #    immediately without wasting 2 more API calls.

      - Emits verdict_breakdown (per-agent audit log)

    CONFIDENCE-WEIGHTED VOTING:
    Each finding has a confidence score. We weight by confidence so a
    finding the agent is 95% sure about counts more than one it is 50% sure about.
    (WIKI: Confidence-Weighted-Voting.md — "multiply verdict weight by confidence
     score before aggregating.")

    SAFETY-THRESHOLD RULE (Phase 8):
    WIKI: Safety-Threshold-Rule.md — "A single agent saying 'critical' downgrades
    to 'label only' to reduce false positives. Require 2+ agents for HITL escalation."

    When ONLY ONE agent returns CRITICAL_BLOCK, we still post REQUEST_CHANGES
    (not NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW). This prevents a single miscalibrated agent from
    triggering HITL on every PR that touches security-adjacent code.
    When 2+ agents return CRITICAL_BLOCK, we escalate to NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW.

    HITL ESCALATION RULES (locked from Phase 0 cognitive design):

    - Rule 4: Only 1 agent succeeded out of 4 -> too little information -> HITL

    verdict_breakdown is ALWAYS emitted (even for APPROVE verdicts).

      The caller (fan_out_agents) unpacks it immediately.

    WHY DICTS AND NOT PYDANTIC MODELS IN THE STATE?
    LangGraph state is a TypedDict. Its checkpointer serializes state to JSON/Redis.
    Pydantic models with Enum fields don't serialize cleanly through that process.
    We call .to_state_dict() on each finding to get a plain dict with string values
    (e.g., severity="critical" not FindingSeverity.CRITICAL).

    The AGENTS THEMSELVES return typed AgentFinding objects (clean Pydantic).
    The CONVERSION TO DICTS happens here, at the boundary between agents and the graph.
    This is the Dependency Inversion boundary: agents know nothing about the graph state.
