# backend/models/review.py
#
# Core Pydantic models for the PR review workflow.
#
# WHAT IS PYDANTIC?
# Pydantic is a data validation library. You define a class with typed fields.
# When you create an instance, Pydantic validates every field automatically.
# If a field is wrong type or missing, you get a clear error immediately.
# This is how we avoid silent data corruption as data flows between modules.
#
# RULE: No business logic in models. Models are data shapes only.
#       A model never calls an API, never queries a database, never makes decisions.
#       It only holds and validates data.
#
# These models represent the data at different stages of a PR review:
#   1. A Finding     = one issue an agent discovered
#   2. An AgentResult = everything one specialist agent produced
#   3. A PRReview    = the complete review of one PR (combines all agent results)
