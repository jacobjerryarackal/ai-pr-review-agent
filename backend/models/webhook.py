# backend/models/webhook.py
#
# Pydantic models for GitHub webhook payloads.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE MODEL FOR WEBHOOKS?
# GitHub sends a large JSON payload with many fields we do not need.
# We parse only the fields we care about into typed models.
# The rest is ignored.
#
# This also acts as a schema contract: if GitHub changes their payload format
# and removes a field we depend on, Pydantic raises a validation error immediately
# rather than a silent KeyError somewhere deep in our business logic.
#
# The GitHub webhook for a pull_request event looks like this (simplified):
# {
#   "action": "opened",
#   "number": 42,
#   "pull_request": {
#     "title": "Add login feature",
#     "head": { "sha": "abc123", "ref": "feature/login" },
#     "base": { "ref": "main" },
#     "diff_url": "https://github.com/.../42.diff",
#     "user": { "login": "ayush488-glitch" }
#   },
#   "repository": {
#     "full_name": "ayush488-glitch/my-project",
#     "clone_url": "https://github.com/ayush488-glitch/my-project.git"
#   }
# }
