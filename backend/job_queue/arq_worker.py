# backend/job_queue/arq_worker.py
#
# ARQ async job queue — the bridge between webhook receipt and review execution.
#
# THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES:
# GitHub sends a webhook and expects a response within 10 seconds.
# A full PR review (4 agents, LLM calls) takes 60-120 seconds.
# If we ran the review synchronously inside the webhook handler, GitHub would
# time out and retry, creating duplicate reviews.
#
# THE SOLUTION:
# Webhook handler -> enqueues a job in Redis (< 100ms) -> returns 200 to GitHub
# ARQ worker      -> picks up the job from Redis -> runs the full review
#
# HOW ARQ WORKS:
# ARQ uses two Redis operations:
#   PRODUCER side (webhook router): LPUSH arq:queue:default [job_payload_json]
#   CONSUMER side (this worker):    BRPOP arq:queue:default [blocks until job appears]
#
# BRPOP is "blocking pop" — the worker sleeps at Redis waiting for a job.
# When a job appears, Redis wakes the worker immediately (no polling loop).
# This is the "push-based notification" pattern from Stream-Processing-Patterns.md
# (as opposed to the anti-pattern of polling a database for new rows).
#
# WORKER FUNCTIONS:
# An ARQ worker function is a coroutine that ARQ calls when a job is dequeued.
# It receives a Context object (ARQ-provided) plus any arguments the producer sent.
# It returns any value (ARQ logs it) or raises an exception (ARQ retries).
#
# RETRY BEHAVIOR:
# By default, ARQ retries a failed job 5 times with exponential backoff.
# Our job is idempotent (idempotency key in Redis prevents duplicate reviews)
# so retries are safe.
#
# FROM Fault-Tolerance.md (distributed-systems wiki):
# "Combine checkpointing with message logging."
# ARQ + LangGraph checkpointing together mean:
#   - ARQ: if the worker crashes, the job is requeued (message logging)
#   - LangGraph: if the review was mid-graph, resume() continues from the checkpoint
# Together: exactly-once review semantics despite worker crashes.
