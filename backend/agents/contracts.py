#
# Phase 8: Formal typed contracts for the multi-agent system.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
# Before Phase 8, agents received positional string arguments and returned
# findings as a raw list. There was no formal contract — any caller could
# pass any string and hope the agent understood it.
#
# This file formalises THREE contracts:
#
#   1. AgentTask (INPUT CONTRACT):
#      A typed dataclass that every agent receives as its input.
#      All agents receive the same shape of input — consistent, validated, documented.
#      Added: `peer_context` — structured summaries of other agents' findings,
#      allowing agents to avoid double-flagging and gain cross-domain awareness.
#
#   2. AgentVerdict (PER-AGENT OUTPUT CONTRACT — verdict dimension):
#      A per-agent conclusion SEPARATE from the system-wide ReviewVerdict.
#      ReviewVerdict is the FINAL system decision (APPROVE / REQUEST_CHANGES /
#      NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW). AgentVerdict is what each INDIVIDUAL agent concludes
#      based solely on its own findings. The arbitrator reads all 4 AgentVerdicts
#      and applies the Safety-Threshold Rule before producing a ReviewVerdict.
#
#   3. VerdictBreakdown (ARBITRATION AUDIT LOG):
#      A list of per-agent verdict records emitted after aggregation.
#      WIKI: Confidence-Weighted-Voting.md — "Hidden Conflict anti-pattern:
#        silently resolving agent disagreements without recording which agents
#        said what. Fix: emit full verdict_breakdown and individual_verdicts
#        in the audit log so conflicts are traceable."
#      Every aggregate_results call emits a VerdictBreakdown. It is stored
#      in state and will be surfaced in the Phase 17 trace viewer.
#
# WIKI CITATIONS:
#   WorkTask-Contract.md:
#     "Each worker needs enough context to solve its problem, but not so much
#      that you blow token budgets."
#   Fan-Out-Fan-In.md / Safety-Threshold-Rule.md:
#     "A single agent saying 'remove' downgrades to 'label' to reduce false
#      positives."
#   Confidence-Weighted-Voting.md:
#     "Merge strategies matter: voting, confidence weighting, safety thresholds,
#      and all-must-pass rules are equally important as the agents themselves."
#
# DEPENDENCY DIRECTION:
#   contracts.py lives in backend/agents/ (the agents layer).
#   It imports ONLY from backend/models/ (the models layer — one level below).
#   Nothing in core/ or orchestrator/ is imported here.
#   This keeps the dependency arrow pointing inward:
#     core <- models <- tools/memory <- agents <- orchestrator
#
# NO CIRCULAR IMPORTS:
#   nodes.py (orchestrator layer) imports AgentTask from here.
#   base_agent.py (agents layer) imports AgentTask from here.
#   contracts.py itself imports only from models/enums.py.

# =============================================================================
# AgentVerdict
#
# Each specialist agent produces its own verdict based solely on its findings.
# This is NOT the final system verdict (ReviewVerdict) — it is the raw signal
# from one domain expert.
#
# WHY THREE VALUES AND NOT TWO (approve/reject)?
#   APPROVE:          No significant issues found in this agent's domain.
#   REQUEST_CHANGES:  HIGH severity issue found. Confident enough to block.
#   CRITICAL_BLOCK:   CRITICAL severity issue found. Immediate escalation signal.
#                     Treated differently from REQUEST_CHANGES in arbitration:
#                     the Safety-Threshold Rule requires 2+ agents to agree on
#                     CRITICAL_BLOCK before the system escalates to HITL.
#                     One miscalibrated agent should not trigger immediate escalation.
#
# WHY NOT JUST USE FindingSeverity?
#   FindingSeverity is per-finding (individual issue severity).
#   AgentVerdict is per-agent (overall conclusion of this domain expert).
#   An agent might find 3 MEDIUM issues but still conclude APPROVE (no blockers).
#   The mapping: CRITICAL finding -> CRITICAL_BLOCK, HIGH -> REQUEST_CHANGES, else -> APPROVE.
# =============================================================================

class AgentVerdict(str, Enum):
    """
    The per-agent conclusion, distinct from the system-wide ReviewVerdict.

    Produced by _derive_per_agent_verdict() in BaseAgent.
    Read by aggregate_results() in nodes.py to apply the Safety-Threshold Rule.
    """

# =============================================================================
# PeerFindingSummary
#
# A compact summary of one agent's findings, shared with other agents
# via AgentTask.peer_context. This is the inter-agent context passing protocol.
#
# WHY COMPACT AND NOT THE FULL FINDING LIST?
#   WIKI: WorkTask-Contract.md — "Give workers only the context keys they need."
#   Passing the full AgentFinding list from a prior agent would:
#     1. Bloat the context window (each finding is ~200 tokens)
#     2. Risk confusing the agent (it might over-anchor on prior agent's framing)
#   A compact summary (agent_type, finding_count, highest_severity, file_paths)
#   gives enough cross-domain awareness to avoid duplicate flagging without
#   blowing the token budget.
#
# PHASE 8 SCOPE:
#   peer_context is populated IN THE SEQUENTIAL CASE only.
#   In the current parallel fan-out (Phase 4), all agents start simultaneously —
#   there are no prior agent results to share at fan-out time.
#   peer_context will be populated in Phase 20 (reflection loop) when a second
#   sequential pass is triggered. For now, agents receive peer_context=[] and
#   the system works exactly as before — this is additive, not breaking.

# AgentTask (INPUT CONTRACT)
#
# The typed input every agent receives. Replaces the 5 positional string
# arguments that used to be passed directly to agent.analyze().
#
# WHY A DATACLASS AND NOT A PYDANTIC MODEL?
#   AgentTask never leaves the process. It is created inside _call_agent_real()
#   in nodes.py and consumed immediately by agent.analyze(). It does not need:
#     - JSON serialization (never hits an API or DB)
#     - Field validators (caller is trusted internal code)
#     - OpenAPI schema generation
#   dataclass(frozen=True) gives us: immutability, repr, eq, type hints.
#   Lightweight, no Pydantic overhead.
#
# WHY frozen=True?
#   Agents must not mutate their input. If an agent could mutate AgentTask,
#   it could affect other agents (they share the same state dict via LangGraph).
#   frozen=True makes mutation a TypeError at runtime, not a silent bug.
