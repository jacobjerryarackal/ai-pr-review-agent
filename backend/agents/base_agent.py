#
# BaseAgent — the abstract parent class for all specialist agents.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE IS:
# Every specialist agent (SecurityAgent, QualityAgent, TestAgent, DocsAgent)
# is a subclass of BaseAgent. The base class handles everything that is common
# to all agents so that each specialist focuses only on what makes it unique.
#
# WHAT THE BASE CLASS DOES (so each specialist doesn't have to):
#   1. CONTEXT TRUNCATION:
#      The diff can be enormous (50k+ tokens for a large PR).
#      We truncate it to the agent's context_budget_tokens BEFORE the LLM call.
#      Truncation is from the bottom — top of the diff has the most important code.
#
#   2. PROMPT ASSEMBLY:
#      The LLM prompt has 4 sections (primacy/recency principle from wiki):
#        [1] MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: "Return JSON. Nothing else."  <- first = remembered
#        [2] Agent's specific instructions (e.g., "Look for SQL injection, XSS...")
#        [3] PR context (title, description, file count, author)
#        [4] The diff itself  <- last = also remembered (recency effect)
#
#   3. THE LLM CALL:
#      Routes to call_openai() or call_anthropic() based on ModelConfig.provider.
#      Returns LLMResponse with parsed content + token counts.
#
#   4. OUTPUT GUARDRAIL (most important):
#      LLMs sometimes return:
#        - Text that isn't JSON at all ("I found 3 issues: 1. ...")
#        - JSON with the wrong schema ({"issues": [...]} instead of {"findings": [...]})
#        - A dict when we expected a list, or vice versa
#        - A list of strings instead of a list of dicts
#      The guardrail handles all these cases:
#        - Valid JSON list of dicts -> parse each into AgentFindingRaw -> AgentFinding
#        - Valid JSON dict with "findings" key -> use that list
#        - Valid JSON but wrong shape -> return empty findings + confidence=0.3 -> HITL
#        - Invalid JSON -> _try_extract_json() attempted, then empty + confidence=0.3 -> HITL
#      confidence=0.3 is below our HITL threshold -> human reviews instead of auto-posting.
#
#   5. AGENT RESULT ASSEMBLY:
#      Returns AgentResult (the Phase 4 model) with findings, confidence, token usage.
#
# WHAT EACH SPECIALIST PROVIDES (by implementing abstract methods):
#   - agent_type property: AgentType.SECURITY / .QUALITY / .TEST / .DOCS
#   - _system_prompt(): the agent's specific instructions to the LLM
#     This is where the real expertise lives. SecurityAgent's prompt is different from
#     QualityAgent's prompt — that's the entire difference between them.
#
# CONTEXT BUDGET (token-based truncation):
# We use a rough approximation: 1 token ≈ 4 characters (standard English/code text).
# This is not exact — real tokenization is BPE-based and model-specific.
# For code, actual token/char ratio is closer to 1:3 (more tokens per char than prose).
# We use 1:4 as a conservative estimate, so we slightly under-use the budget.
# This is safe — better to under-use than to exceed the context window and get an error.
# Phase 10 (Observability) will add real token counting (tiktoken for OpenAI).

    WHY NOT USE THE EXISTING AgentResult FROM models/review.py?
    AgentResult (in review.py) was designed for Phase 3 — it has fields like
    agent_name, category, duration_seconds that match the orchestrator's
    state schema. It uses Finding (not AgentFinding) for its findings list.

    AgentOutput is the agents layer's OWN return type. It lives here,
    in the agents module. It is then converted to finding dicts by
    _call_agent_real() in nodes.py at the orchestrator boundary.

    This keeps the dependency direction clean:
      agents layer -> produces AgentOutput
      orchestrator boundary -> converts AgentOutput to state dicts
      state/AgentResult -> used by the orchestrator internally

        MAPPING LOGIC:

          - Only MEDIUM/LOW findings, or no findings -> APPROVE
            (either nothing wrong, or issues are informational)

        WHY CRITICAL_BLOCK IS SEPARATE FROM REQUEST_CHANGES:
          The Safety-Threshold Rule (wiki: Safety-Threshold-Rule.md) requires
          2+ agents to agree on CRITICAL_BLOCK before the system escalates to
          NEEDS_HUMAN_REVIEW. This prevents a single miscalibrated agent from
          triggering HITL on every PR. The aggregator reads all 4 AgentVerdicts
          and counts how many agents said CRITICAL_BLOCK before acting.

        WHY APPROVE WHEN AGENT FAILED (no findings)?
          If an agent fails entirely, it returns findings=[] with error_message set.
          We return APPROVE here because we have NO POSITIVE EVIDENCE of issues —
          the agent couldn't check. The aggregator handles the failure separately

        """
        Call a registered tool, enforcing this agent's capability scope first.

        THREE-GATE PATTERN (wiki: Autonomous-Action-Agents):
          Gate 1 — capability_scope.raise_if_not_allowed():
                   Is this agent ALLOWED to call this tool at all?
                   Raises CapabilityViolationError on policy violation.
          Gate 2 — tool_registry.call():
                   Does this tool EXIST and are required args present?
                   Raises KeyError on unknown tool, ValueError on missing args.
          Gate 3 — sandbox (inside the tool handler, if applicable):
                   Is the execution SAFE? (timeout, output limit, language allowlist)

        WHY scope is checked FIRST (before registry):
            If we checked the registry first, a valid tool name would pass the
            KeyError guard even if the agent isn't allowed to call it.
            The capability check is a security gate — it must come before execution.

        WHY synchronous (not async):
            The current tool handlers are all synchronous (regex, subprocess).
            Async tools (HTTP-based advisories in Phase 14) will need an
            async variant. For Phase 7 sync is correct and simpler.

        Args:
            tool_name: name of a registered tool (e.g. "check_secrets_pattern")
            args:      arguments dict matching the tool's input_schema

        Returns:
            dict[str, Any] — tool result (shape documented per-tool in ToolSchema)

        Raises:
            CapabilityViolationError: agent is not allowed to call this tool
            KeyError:                 tool is not registered
