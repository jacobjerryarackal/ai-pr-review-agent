#
# HITL Escalation Policy — Phase 19.
#
# RESPONSIBILITY:
#   Given the output of aggregate_results, decide WHETHER a review should be
#   escalated to the HITL queue instead of auto-posted to GitHub.
#
# DESIGN (Clean-Architecture.md wiki — Business-Rules):
#   This module is a pure ENTITY — escalation rules are Critical Business Rules
#   that exist independent of any delivery mechanism.
#   - Zero imports from FastAPI, Starlette, or HTTP types.
#   - Zero database calls. Operates only on plain Python data.
#   - The orchestrator (nodes.py) calls should_escalate() and passes the result
#     to queue.py if True. Dependency flows inward.
#
# ESCALATION RULES (locked in Phase 0 cognitive design, threshold adjusted Phase 18):
#   Rule 1: Security agent failed       -> cannot safely approve -> HITL
#   Rule 2: 3+ agents say CRITICAL      -> Safety-Threshold rule -> HITL
#   Rule 3: Overall confidence < 0.40   -> agent is uncertain    -> HITL
#   Rule 4: Only 1 agent succeeded      -> too little data        -> HITL
#
# WHY THESE RULES LIVE HERE (not in nodes.py):
#   nodes.py already has escalation logic but it is INLINE — interleaved with
#   LangGraph state manipulation. That makes the rules hard to test, reuse, or
#   change independently. This module extracts the rules into a named, testable
#   function. nodes.py will call this function in Phase 19 instead of re-implementing.
#
# THRESHOLD HISTORY:
#   Phase 8:  threshold = 2+ CRITICAL (too aggressive, hid reviews silently)
#   Phase 18: threshold = 3+ CRITICAL (demo-day-readiness pitfall #34)
#   Phase 19: threshold = 3+ CRITICAL (confirmed, no change)

    Apply escalation policy rules to the aggregate_results output.

                                 or returned an error verdict.

        overall_confidence:      Weighted-average confidence across all agents (0.0–1.0).
