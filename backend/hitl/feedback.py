# backend/hitl/feedback.py
#
# HITL Feedback — Phase 19.
#
# RESPONSIBILITY:
#   Persist a human HITL decision as a labelled training signal (HITLFeedback row).
#   This is the data pipeline entry point for Phase 20 (Continuous Learning).
#
# DESIGN (Derived-Data-Systems.md wiki):
#   HITLFeedback is DERIVED data.
#   Source of truth: HITLReview row.
#   This module reformats the human decision into a shape suitable for
#   offline dataset construction (Phase 20 fine-tuning pipeline).
#   Can be rebuilt from HITLReview rows at any time.
#
# FEEDBACK TYPES:
#   "override"     — human changed the agent's verdict (agent was wrong)
#   "confirmation" — human agreed with the agent (agent was right)
#   "dismiss"      — human dismissed without a clear verdict (inconclusive)
#
#   Phase 20's reflection loop uses OVERRIDE rows to detect systematic errors.
#   CONFIRMATION rows are also useful — they tell us what the agent got right.
#   (LLMOps-Essentials.md wiki: "Human feedback is the ground truth signal
#    for alignment. Record it faithfully.")
#
# PHASE 20 CONTRACT:
#   This module's output schema (HITLFeedback columns) is stable from Phase 19.
#   Phase 20 reads this table directly — do not rename columns.
#   Add new columns additively if needed (Encoding-and-Schema-Evolution.md).
