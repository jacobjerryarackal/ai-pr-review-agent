# backend/memory/context_retriever.py
#
# The single entry point for RAG context retrieval.
#
# WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
#   1. Takes a PR diff as the "query" — what are we looking for?
#   2. Embeds the first MAX_QUERY_CHARS of the diff (a semantic fingerprint)
#   3. Asks Qdrant: "what code have we seen before that looks like this?"
#   4. Formats the top results as a plain text context string
#   5. Returns that string to be injected into the agent prompts
#
# SINGLE ENTRY POINT PRINCIPLE (from Decoupling-and-Law-of-Demeter.md wiki):
#   "A module should talk to its immediate neighbors, not reach through them."
#   nodes.py calls retrieve_context_for_diff() ONLY.
#   It does not import embedder.py or qdrant_client.py.
#   If we replace Qdrant with Weaviate, only this file and qdrant_client.py change.
#   nodes.py is untouched.
#
# GRACEFUL DEGRADATION — THE CARDINAL RULE:
# (From Production-Hardening.md wiki, "Defense in Depth"):
#   "Each guardrail is independent. Each can block."
#   Applied here as: each failure point is independent. Each returns "".
#   Failure at any step returns "" immediately:
#     - Empty diff         -> return ""
#     - Embed fails        -> return ""  (EmbeddingError caught)
#     - Qdrant unavailable -> return ""  (search returns [] on error)
#     - No results found   -> return ""
#   The review pipeline receives "" and runs with diff-only analysis.
#   This is NOT a degraded experience — it is the DESIGNED fallback.
#   RAG context is enhancement, not foundation.
#
# QUERY CONSTRUCTION:
# (From RAG-Architecture.md wiki):
#   "Dense embeddings capture semantic understanding."
#   We embed the FIRST part of the diff (the changed code) not the entire diff.
#   The first part of a unified diff contains the most semantically dense content:
#   file headers, hunk headers, the actual changed lines.
#   We cap at MAX_QUERY_CHARS to stay within embedding API limits.
#
# CONTEXT FORMAT:
# The output is a plain text block:
#   --- Relevant prior code context ---
#   [File: src/auth.py (from PR #17)]
#   <code chunk text>
#   ---
#   [File: src/utils.py (from PR #15)]
#   <code chunk text>
#   ---
#
# This format was chosen because:
#   1. Agents get a labeled context block they can cite ("see prior context for auth.py")
#   2. File names are explicit — agents can say "auth.py was seen before and had pattern X"
#   3. PR number is included — human reviewers can trace the provenance
#
# (RAG-Architecture.md: "Citation grounding: every retrieved chunk must carry provenance.")

    Retrieves RAG context for a PR diff.

    Queries Qdrant for code chunks similar to this diff and returns them
    as a formatted context string for injection into agent prompts.

    GRACEFUL DEGRADATION:
    This function NEVER raises. On any failure, it returns "".
    The caller (build_context node in nodes.py) uses the result as:
        retrieved_context = await retrieve_context_for_diff(diff, repo, settings)
        # retrieved_context is always a str — may be empty string

    Args:
        diff:           The PR unified diff string
        repo_full_name: "owner/repo" — scopes retrieval to this repo only
        settings:       Optional Settings instance. If None, calls get_settings().
                        (Dependency injection for testability —
                         Design-by-Contract.md: "pass context explicitly.")

    Returns:

    WHY PLAIN TEXT AND NOT JSON?
    The context is part of an LLM prompt, not an API response.
    Plain text is more token-efficient and agents reason about it more naturally.
    JSON keys add token overhead without adding semantics.
