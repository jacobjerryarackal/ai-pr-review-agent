# backend/memory/redis_client.py
#
# Redis client — the ONLY place in the codebase that talks to Redis directly.
#
# WHY A WRAPPER INSTEAD OF USING redis DIRECTLY?
# Without this wrapper, any module that needs Redis would:
#   1. Create its own connection
#   2. Know the Redis URL (config coupling)
#   3. Handle connection errors on its own
#   4. Need to be updated if we switch Redis libraries
#
# With this wrapper:
#   - ONE connection pool, shared across all uses (efficient)
#   - ONE place to handle connection errors
#   - The rest of the codebase calls: await redis_client.check_idempotency_key("...")
#     It does not know or care that Redis is involved
#
# LAW OF DEMETER APPLIED:
# The router does not call redis.get(key). It calls check_idempotency_key(key).
# The router only talks to its immediate neighbor (this client).
# It does not reach through to the Redis library.
#
# FROM Stream-Processing-Patterns.md (DDIA wiki):
# "Use a durable message broker, not polling a DB."
# Redis with LPUSH/BRPOP is the durable broker pattern — not polling.
# Our idempotency keys use Redis SETEX (set with expiry) — fast, atomic, durable.
#
# FROM Stability Patterns (release-it wiki):
# "Every external call is a potential stab-in-the-back."
# Every public method here wraps its Redis call in try/except.
# Callers get a clean error (MemoryStoreError) not a raw redis exception.

    Thin wrapper around the async Redis client.

      - idempotency key management (deduplication)

      - workflow state caching (quick status checks)

    # Cache-aside pattern for review status.
    # (From Polyglot-Persistence.md wiki, "Caching Patterns"):
    #   "Read from cache first. On miss, read from Postgres. Write back to cache."
    #   Redis = fast O(1) key-value lookup for "what is review X doing now?"

    #   pending -> in_progress -> agents_running -> aggregating -> posting -> completed
    # A typical review completes in <60 seconds. 300s is plenty before TTL expiry.
    # After TTL, the next read goes to Postgres (cache miss -> fall through to DB).
    # Stale cache is acceptable: showing "in_progress" for an extra few minutes
    # is not a correctness issue — it is a display convenience.

    #  when the primary store is always authoritative.")
