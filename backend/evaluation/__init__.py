#
# Phase 9: Evaluation Systems
#
# Exports the three core evaluation components so callers can do:
#   from backend.evaluation import GoldenPR, PRReviewJudge, RegressionGate
#
# Design: evaluation is a parallel system to the agent system.
# Wiki (Evaluation-Frameworks.md): "Your evaluation is a parallel system.
# They should look similar."  The three layers here mirror:
#   golden_dataset  <->  Input Processing
#   judge           <->  Agent Reasoning
#   regression_gate <->  Output / Metrics
