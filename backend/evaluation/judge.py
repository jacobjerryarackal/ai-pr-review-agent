#
# Phase 9: LLM-as-Judge for PR Review Evaluation
#
# Wiki (Evaluation-Frameworks.md): "The cleanest way to evaluate agent outputs
# at scale is to use another LLM as a judge. The catch: the judge itself
# introduces variability. You need to manage this."
#
# Key design decisions:
#
# 1. PRReviewJudge takes an injected LLMClient -- same infrastructure as the
#    agents themselves. No raw anthropic/openai import here. This keeps the
#    dependency direction clean (evaluation -> tools, not evaluation -> third-party).
#
# 2. The judge evaluates THREE criteria for PR review:
#    - verdict_correct  (bool)  : did the agent produce the expected verdict?
#    - finding_coverage (0-1)   : what fraction of expected findings appeared?
#    - severity_accuracy (0-1)  : were the severities at or above expected minimums?
#    Overall score = weighted combination of the three.
#
# 3. Calibration method: run judge on examples where we already know ground
#    truth. Wiki: "target agreement with humans > 80%."
#
# 4. ANTI-PATTERN AVOIDED: The judge did NOT generate GOLDEN_DATASET.
#    The judge evaluates against human-authored fixtures. This is the
#    JudgeOverfitting anti-pattern fix from the wiki.
#
# 5. _build_judge_prompt() is a private helper -- the prompt is inlined, not
#    loaded from the prompt registry. Reason: eval is not an agent call path,
#    and the judge prompt is not user-configurable policy. It's infrastructure.
