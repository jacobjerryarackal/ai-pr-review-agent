"""Typed event vocabulary for the PR Review Agent observability layer.

WHY A TYPED ENUM?
  Unstructured string event names drift over time -- 'review.started' becomes
  'review_started' becomes 'ReviewStarted' in different parts of the codebase.
  A StrEnum is the single source of truth: every emitted event, every log entry,
  every audit record uses ReviewEvent.X so grep finds everything.

  Borrowed pattern from opensre analytics/events.py (analytics/events.py:8-60),
  which uses the same StrEnum approach for all lifecycle events.

  Wiki: "Emit every log entry as a JSON object with a consistent schema" --
  typed events are the schema anchor that makes the promise enforceable.

NAMING CONVENTION
  Format: <resource>.<action>  (lowercase, dot-separated)
  resource: webhook | review | agent | llm | tool | verdict | hitl | audit
  action:   past-tense verb (received, started, completed, failed, escalated, ...)
