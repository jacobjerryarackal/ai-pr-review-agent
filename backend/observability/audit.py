"""Append-only JSONL audit log for PR Review decisions.

DESIGN OVERVIEW
  Every consequential decision in the review pipeline gets an immutable record
  appended to a JSONL file (one JSON object per line).  Nothing is ever updated
  or deleted -- this is an audit trail, not a database.

  Pattern borrowed directly from opensre guardrails/audit.py (AuditLogger):
    - Constructor takes an optional path (defaults to a sensible location)
    - log() never raises on write failure (observability must not crash reviews)
    - read_recent(limit) returns the tail of the log for dashboards

  Wiki: "In regulated industries, agents accessing sensitive data without
  immutable audit logs creates legal exposure."  Even though PR review is not
  strictly regulated, the pattern costs nothing and pays dividends at Phase 15
  (Governance & Compliance).

JSONL VS DATABASE
  A JSONL file is:
    - Readable by any tool (grep, jq, Python open())
    - Appendable atomically per-line (no transactions needed)
    - Rotatable with logrotate
    - Importable into any log aggregator (Loki, Splunk, etc.)

  Phase 15 will layer structured querying on top -- for now the file is enough.

SENSITIVE DATA POLICY
  We do NOT log PR diff content or full LLM prompt/response text here.
  The audit log is metadata-only: review_id, verdict, agent_types, timestamps.
  This prevents the audit log itself from becoming a data-exfil vector.
  (Phase 11 Security Architecture formalises this into a masking policy.)
