# Phase 16 — BudgetGuard: hard daily-cap enforcement on LLM spend.
#
# CONTRACT:
#   - check_daily_budget() is called BEFORE expensive LLM calls.
#   - On breach: raises BudgetExceededError. Caller (base_agent) catches and
#     returns a degraded AgentOutput (confidence=0.3, no findings) — this
#     naturally routes the review through the HITL queue without any extra
#     plumbing, because the review aggregator already escalates low-confidence
#     reviews.
#
# WHY ONLY THE DAILY CAP?
#   Per-review caps require coordinating across parallel fan-out agents (4
#   agents firing simultaneously cannot share a precise running total without
#   a distributed lock). We surface per-review spend as a *metric* on the
#   summary endpoint and let Phase 20 use those numbers to retrain routing
#   decisions. Daily cap is the single number that actually matters for "did
#   we burn $10k overnight".
#
# FAIL-OPEN BEHAVIOR:
#   If the daily-spend query itself fails (DB hiccup), we log and PASS the
#   budget check. Telemetry failures must not block the pipeline. The wiki is
#   explicit: "Telemetry that fails the request is anti-telemetry."
